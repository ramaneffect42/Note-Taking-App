# Note Taking App
## Note Taking App in JavaScript. I used HTML, CSS and JS to build this functioning Note taking app with a drak mode, edit and delete features. it is a project i did to strengthen my basics in javascript. 

## Key Concepts I Learnt: 
1. Function Definition with parameters and arguments
2. Local Storage (getItem, setItem)
3. UI/UX matters a lot when designing an application, you must have a general idea of what it should look like before you start to code.
4. DOM Manipulation
5. Event Listeners
6. event.preventDefault() ===> stopping the page from reloading
7. managing the different notes seperately from the DOM Content and the array data.

8. CSS Conncept: using variables at the top and re-using them throught the file, better for redudancy and updating colors across the page
